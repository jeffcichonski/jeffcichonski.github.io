<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">It all started in the summer of 2006 at Wegmans, where Christina and Andrew both worked. Christina was known as “Boss Lady” and remains ever since.
They spent many months as friends until July 5th, 2007 when they started officially dating. Christina left for college shortly after at West Chester University.  
They spent many months driving back and forth to spend time together. Eventually, Christina transferred to a school closer to home, 
and rejoined Andrew at Wegmans, working together again. </br></br>

In 2010, Christina and Andrew got their dog, Bentley, and he has been their little troublemaker ever since.  
Later that year, they moved into an apartment together in Fort Lauderdale, Fl.</br></br>

On December 13, 2013, Andrew took Christina to Jimmy's Restaurant and Chocolate Shop for dinner, a place they frequent.  
He surprised her with a table on the balcony, champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, and asked her to marry him. She of course said yes! </br></br>

Now, Andrew, Christina and Bentley are living in Northern Fort Lauderdale, planning their wedding. They feel like they are already living 
the married life, yet can’t wait to make it official on April 18th, 2015! They hope you can be there to celebrate with them!</h3>

						<p class="text-muted"> (Only sibling of the Bride) I met Andrew back in High School since he was in my graduating class.  We became friends easily and have been ever since; although once Christina and Andrew started dating we became more like brother and sister than best friends.  I grew up in Allentown, PA and moved to Fort Lauderdale, FL with my family in 2010.  I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice and Public Administration and am currently working at the Humane Society of Broward County where I started working in admissions, moved to admissions supervisor, and now work as an outpatient clinic administrator.  Anyone who knows me knows I am doing what I love, which is working with animals.  Of course I have my own dog who is a big baby, Jack who is now 4 years old and is Bentley’s best friend.</p>

                        <h4>Jeffrey Cichonski</h4>
                        <h6>Best Man</h6>
						<p class="text-muted"> Andy and Jeff met in the fifth grade while conducting an experiment to see if staples rust at the bottom of an Elmer’s Gel Glue bottle (they did). Their friendship continued into middle school when they became boy scouts in Troop 29 of Cetronia, enjoyed Saturdays at the dirt bike track, and spent summers at the Jersey Shore. As they transitioned to high school, boy scouts just didn’t seem as cool anymore, and the 80CC motorbikes were replaced by car shows where they drooled over the coolest cars on the market. However, Mr. Eggert quickly convinced these 'Petrol Heads' that no rice burner could ever compare to the awesome muscle cars of the early years. One summer during high school, Jeff started working at Wegman’s and noticed a pretty girl with brown hair during orientation. Soon after, Andy was hired and also took notice of the brown-haired girl whom we now know as Christina. Jeff had no shot. Andy found the girl for him. Andy and Jeff eventually ditched the glamorous life of cart-pushing and grocery-bagging and co-founded Grassroots Lawn Mowing company where they cut grass, landscaped, and completed odd truck-required tasks for more than a dozen clients. By this time, Andy and Christina had solidified their status as the Wegman’s power couple. After college, Andy went south and took up the rod and reel, and Jeff moved to DC where he works with technology. They remain friends and attempt to get together as much as possible.

						<p class="text-muted"> My name is Keri Bond and Christina is one of my best friends. I am an elementary school teacher but I am currently a stay at home mom to the most amazing little boy, Jackson. I met Christina in college at FAU. We had to take “Teaching English as a Second Language” for our degree and she would always sit in the back and play solitaire on her Kindle at the beginning of class. She seemed like a really nice person and was pretty quiet, just like me. I started sitting next to her and before I knew if we were best friends. My husband and I love getting together with Christina and Andrew (and to play Pictionary with them, too). It is very refreshing to be around a positive couple who truly love each other. I was honored to have Christina standing next to me on the altar on my big day and I am so excited and honored to be standing next to her on her big day. </p>

						<p class="text-muted"> 
						I first met Andy when I moved back to S. Florida from Connecticut in 2011. I was hired By Harry at Nautic and Co. America and was in charge of the fiberglass department. I had to let go of my helpers due to poor job performance along with the fact that he cut a hole in one of our boss’s boat. I still needed a helper so I began to teach Andy the art of fiberglass work and that’s where the friendship began. Since then, Andy now plays a major role in our fishing team and comes out on the boat whenever he gets free time. I’ve had pleasure to hang out with Christina on the boat on multiple occasions and we all went to Disney World together. We also managed to hook Christina up with her first sailfish a few months back and that was very impressive. I could go on and on, but that about sums it up. I very proud to call Andy one of my best friends and I	wish Andrew and Christina the best of luck on the next chapter of their life together. I love you guys

						<p class="text-muted"> Andy and Matt met as youth lacrosse players in middle school, and they became friends throughout the rest of Andy’s days in the Lehigh Valley. When Andy moved  to Ft. Lauderdale, they became fishing buddies as Matt saw the opportunity to pursue his passion for saltwater fishing while crashing on Andy and Christina’s couch. Andy and Christina may see this as annoying, but Bentley loves when Matt comes to visit!

                        <h6>Groomsman</h6>
						<p class="text-muted"> Andy and I first met before we entered the sixth grade at Springhouse Middle School. I can remember thinking that Andy is the coolest kid on the block. It seemed as if he had everything going for him. Merely by the age of 10, Andy had already acquired his very own cell phone, girlfriend, and not only one, but two Go-Ped motorized scooters. I thought to myself, “this is a guy after my own heart.” Of course, we instantly hit it off. Andy and I shared great memories throughout the years that followed. Together, along with a close group of friends, we outgrew our adolescence and matured into adulthood.

						As our time at Parkland High School began to wind down, Andy got a part time job at Wegmans, the local supermarket. For some odd reason, Andy was extremely eager to push shopping carts every chance he could get, even while it was extremely cold outside. Not even a blizzard would keep him from pushing those carts. When I would visit Andy at work, I never understood how he could possibly enjoy pushing shopping carts so much on the coldest days of winter. It was like he was on a mission and nothing could get in his way. Upon one visit however, I was introduced to his new boss, Christina. At that moment, everything finally made sense. It was obvious that Christina had to be extremely special for Andy to trench through that slush filled parking lot, day and night, just so he could spend more time with her.

						After a few winters like that, I was not surprised when Andy said he would be moving to Florida. In the end, it looks like all those freezing nights definitely paid off. I am very proud to call Andy one of my best friends and extremely happy to see him journey through life with Christina.</p>

						Groom's second youngest sister. Christina and I met back when I was in elementary school. I'm currently a senior at Parkland High School and working at Panera Bread. I plan on going to college to study speech-language pathology. Flying down to visit Andrew and Christina is always something I look forward to. A funny memory I've had with Christina was one Christmas when we all went to pick a tree and Christina and I suffered together since we both hate cold weather.

I met Christina while Andy, Jeff, and I worked at Wegmans in high school.  I'm sure that was an "experience" she will never forget. Anyways, Andy, Christina, I have made sure to say in touch since their move to Florida and hangout every time they come back to visit Pennsylvania. I wish them both a happy and joyful life together.</p>

						So the story starts out with a random after work fishing trip with my coworker Mike Yankowski, he’s somewhere in this list too. He then tells me a friend of his will be joining us, this is where Andy comes in. A few caught fish and some drinks later that’s where the friendship began. From there, Andy began working with Mike and I. Being the only guys in the office we instantly clicked in order to stay sane. And now in comes Christina. During our annual office Holiday party is where she made her presence known. She seemed quiet at first, but that was only at first.... Her and my girlfriend seemed to hit it off right away and we all enjoyed the festivities. Since then we have gone to many events together including a trip to Disney, beer tastings at our favorite German joint, Moonfest where we were able to get Andy dressed up like a Skeleton...Oh yea that happened... and last but not least the most fantastic Frozen party ever! With that said, I haven’t known these two for very long but they have made an impact. They are wonderful people and I am extremely happy to have met them. I wish them the happiest of marriages and all the best that life has to offer!
